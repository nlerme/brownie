Presentation
------------
Brownie is a C++ graphical user interface intended to simulate random walks on the Z^2 network in an interactive way. It can be for instance used to reproduce the experiment of the [Galton board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine). This software is distributed under LGPL license. An example extracted from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhAsa9dmlv0) is given below:

Requirements
------------
* The [OpenGL](https://opengl.org/) library for handling graphics.
* The [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/) library for loading OpenGL extensions.
* The [SDL1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/) library as window manager.
* The [freetype](https://freetype.org/) library for fonts rendering.

Compilation
-----------
Once the archive decompressed, just type `make` in a terminal.

Execution
---------
The graphical user interface can be executed by typing `./main` in a terminal. Starting points as well as probabilities in the eight directions can be modified during simulations using mouse and keyboard (see instructions).

Documentation
-------------
The LaTeX / HTML documentation in the "doc" directory can be generated by typing `make doc` in a terminal.
