Presentation
------------
Brownie is a C++ graphical user interface intended to simulate random walks on the Z^2 network in an interactive way. It can be for instance used to reproduce the experiment of the [Galton board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean_machine). This software is distributed under LGPL license and is built upon the SDL, freetype, freetype and GLEW libraries. An example extracted from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhAsa9dmlv0) is given below:
